# 😊 Sentiment Analysis Web Application

An end-to-end AI-powered Sentiment Analysis Web Application built using Machine Learning, FastAPI, and a responsive HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend. The application analyzes user-entered text and predicts whether the sentiment is **Positive**, **Neutral**, or **Negative**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the complete Machine Learning workflow:

- Data Collection
- Data Cleaning
- Text Preprocessing
- Feature Engineering (TF-IDF)
- Model Training
- Model Evaluation
- Model Serialization
- FastAPI Backend Development
- Frontend Development
- Frontend & Backend Integration
- Testing
- Deployment

The trained Machine Learning model is exposed through a FastAPI REST API and connected to a user-friendly web interface.
